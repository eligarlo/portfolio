> Definition of trim, _"To cut away unnecessary parts from something."_ - Oxford Dictionary.

Sometimes, validating forms in JavaScript can be a tedious task for a developer. You have to check many things. For instance, that the values given are of the type you expect them to be (string, number, object...), that they are not `undefined` or `null`. And after all that validation, you realize that a user typed an empty `string`. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

One of the most common issues about empty strings a developer can face is the one that has spaces.

```javascript
console.log(myInput)
// '      ' üëà Empty String
```

How can you prevent this from happening? In JavaScript, there are five different methods (actually there are three and two aliases) you can use. Let's check what they do.

## Use Case

In a login form, you have an input where the user needs to enter a username like the one below.

<Image
	alt={`login form`}
	src={`https://media.giphy.com/media/WRD4arnA3ed8A1ceaD/giphy.gif`}
	width={500}
	height={271}
	priority
/>

üëÜ Did you notice the whitespace at the beginning and the end of the input?

If we have a look at our code, the `input` would be like this:

```html
<input class="username" placeholder="Enter Username" type="text" />
```

And the JavaScript like this:

```javascript
const userNameInput = document.querySelector('.username')

console.log(userNameInput)
//	'   Eliahu Garcia Lozano   '
```

Time to get rid of the whitespaces üßπ.

## TrimStart and TrimLeft

These two will remove the whitespace from the beginning of a string.

```javascript
console.log(userNameInput.trimStart())
//	'Eliahu Garcia Lozano   '
console.log(userNameInput.trimLeft())
//	'Eliahu Garcia Lozano   '
```

## TrimEnd and TrimRight

These two will remove the whitespace from the end of a string.

```javascript
console.log(userNameInput.trimEnd())
//	'   Eliahu Garcia Lozano'
console.log(userNameInput.trimRight())
//	'   Eliahu Garcia Lozano'
```

With these methods, we either removed the whitespace from the beginning or the end of a string but, what if you need to remove the whitespace from both sides?

> trimStart and trimEnd are methods while trimLeft and trimRight are aliases of those methods.

## Chaining the methods

You can use them together to get the desired result.

```javascript
console.log(userNameInput.trimStart().trimEnd())
//	'Eliahu Garcia Lozano'
console.log(userNameInput.trimRight().trimLeft())
//	'Eliahu Garcia Lozano'
```

Ok, maybe it is a little bit ugly I know. Let's check the last method, actually the one I use.

## Trim

Just like chaining methods, trim will remove the whitespace from left and right; plus, your code will look cleaner. üòÖ

```javascript
console.log(userNameInput.trim())
//	'Eliahu Garcia Lozano'
```

## Validating the input

In many places I've seen this kind of `string` validation:

```javascript
if (userNameInput !== '') {
	// do something
}
```

The problem with this is that the user may enter whitespace.

Now that we know how to `trim` the value of the input, let's see how to implement it in our form validation.

```javascript
if (userNameInput.trim() !== '') {
	// do something
}
```

Do you see the difference?

## Conclusion

We saw how to remove the whitespace from just the beginning or the end of a string as from both sides at the same time.

Remember:

- .trimStart() & .trimLeft() will remove whitespace from the left.
- .trimEnd() & .trimRight() will remove whitespace from the right.
- .trim() will remove whitespace from both the left and the right side.

From now on, Trim Your `<Inputs>`! (if you didn't before).
