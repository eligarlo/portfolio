title: 'Default Function Parameters'
summary: 'This post delves into the use of default function parameters in JavaScript, a feature introduced in ES2015 (ES6). It discusses how this feature can simplify function argument validation, using a Tip Calculator as an example. The post is ideal for developers looking to understand and utilize this ES6 feature for cleaner, more efficient code.'

We always have to validate if the arguments passed in a function have a value or they are `undefined` but, do we really?

## Introduction

In my last post, I talked about [Destructuring Assignment In A Function Parameter][prev post] and why it is handy when you have optional parameters in a function and don't want to pass `undefined` or `null`.

With that been said, what if you have a function where all the parameters are required? Again, since ES2015 (aka ES6) this can be easily implemented. Let's dive in.

## Use Case

If you take a Tip Calculator project as an example, you probably will need always the same parameters:

1. Bill Amount.
2. Number of People.
3. Service Quality.

The function you'll need would look like this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
function calculateTip(totalBill, numOfPeople, serviceQuality) {
	// Your validation here
	// Your code here
}

console.log(calculateTip(50, 2, 0.2))
// 5.00
```

Inside the function, you'll have to do all the calculations **AND** all the validation; plus, most of the time I go with the same friend (2 people) and leave the standard tip (20%).

In this case, the only parameter that will be changing all the time will be the bill amount.

So, let's give _numOfPeople_ and _serviceQuality_ a default parameter:

```javascript
function calculateTip(totalBill, numOfPeople = 2, serviceQuality = 0.2) {
	// Your code here
}

console.log(calculateTip(50))
// 5.00
console.log(calculateTip(75))
// 7.50
```

Now, just when someone else is joining, or we want to leave a different tip percentage, it will be necessary to pass the rest of the arguments.

## Conclusion

You don't really need to check if the argument in a function is `undefined`, you can create a default value for it.

When a different value is provided, the default value will be overwritten.
