<Callout>
	Let's be honest, **outdated copyright disclaimers on a website looks bad**. Looks like the website
	it's unmaintained on many levels. On the other hand, you don't want to manually update it every
	1st of January on every website you own right? Let me help you **automate this task with 2 lines
	of code**. If you want to know more about the importance of updating your copyright dates I found
	[this post][sonet digital] with a more in-depth explanation.
</Callout>

First, let's create a basic HTML template where we will have our copyright disclaimer at the footer:

```html
<body>
	// Content of your website

	<footer>Copyright Â© <span id="copyright"></span>, My Company Name</footer>

	<script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
```

And then, our javascript will look like this:

```javascript
const copyright = document.querySelector('#copyright')
copyright.innerHTML = new Date().getFullYear()
```

That's it, you are cover now. ðŸ˜Ž

Bonus tip:ðŸ’¡

In case you need a range of years instead of a single year in your copyright disclaimer, you can easily tweak the above code.

```html
<footer>Copyright Â© <span id="copyright">2010 - </span>, My Company Name</footer>
```

```javascript
const copyright = document.querySelector('#copyright')
copyright.innerHTML += new Date().getFullYear()
```
