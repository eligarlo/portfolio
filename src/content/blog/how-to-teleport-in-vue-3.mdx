A few days ago I decided it was time for me to update myself to the new version of Vuejs, Vue 3. And today I wanted to share with you the first thing I learn that version two didn't have, the _teleport_ component.

It's well known that modern web applications fit in a div.

<StaticTweet id='1346423883285499904' />

Ok, React uses _#root_ and Vue uses _#app_ but they just do the same, which is inject the JavaScript code into that div. So here it comes the question:

## What if I have an element I want to display as a sibling of the _#app_ element in the html?

Sometimes we have a loader or a modal (aka popup) component that is not part of the app, but anyway, it will be injected inside the _#app_ element. Thus, the html will look like this:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<div id="app">
			<!-- Other injected HTML here -->
			<div class="loader">
				<!-- HTML for the loader goes here -->
			</div>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Let's teleport!

To use the teleport component in your app, you need to first, add a sibling to the _#app_ element in the html.

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<div id="app"></div>
		<!-- built files will be auto injected -->
		<div class="loader"></div>
		<!-- loader component will be injected here -->
	</body>
</html>
```

Once you've done that, go to your _.vue_ file and use the teleport component:

```html
<template>
	<teleport to=".loader" v-if="showLoader">
		<Loader />
	</teleport>
	<!-- The logic of your component goes below -->
</template>
```

And that's it. Now, when the showLoader condition is met, the loader will show in the specified html element. Notice that I used a CSS selector so if the element was an id, I could have done it like this: `<teleport to="#loader" v-if="showLoader">`
