### Hi _vue_ and welcome to **VueJs, The Series** 🚀

> **Spoiler alert**🚨: In case you missed [VueJs - Getting Started][previous episode] go and check it out.

## What is Interpolation?

When we talk about interpolation, aka "String Interpolation", we talk about the "Mustache" syntax we saw in the [previous episode][previous episode], `{{ }}`.

There are 4 types of interpolations:

1. Text
2. JavaScript Expressions
3. Raw HTML
4. Attributes

## Text

We already saw it when we had this HTML.

```html
<div id="app">
	<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
</div>
```

Let's also bring our Vue instance for reference.

```javascript
new Vue({
	el: '#app',
	data: {
		title: "I'm Interpolating!",
	},
})
```

We see that Vue is accessing the _data_ property inside our Vue instance, is grabbing the _title_ and 'binding' it's value inside our `{{ title }}`. That's it, there is nothing else to see here. 👀

## JavaScript Expressions

Vue supports JavaScript expressions, so basically we can throw any JavaScript code inside.

```jsx
<div id="app">
	<div>2 * 2 = {{ 2 * 2 }}</div>
	<div>Today is {{ new Date().toDateString() }}</div>
	// It also works with ternary expressions
	<div>And the output is: {{ foo ? 'bar' : 'baz' }}</div>
</div>
```

The output of the ternary? 🤷‍♂️

It will be _baz_ because _foo_ is undefined in our Vue instance, so is evaluated as false.

> ⚠Attention⚠, Vue will bind only one single expression, so the following code won't run.

```html
<div id="app">
	<div>{{ let myVariable = 'be' }}</div>
	<div>{{ if (foo) { return 'bar' } }}</div>
</div>
```

The code above won't work because neither is JavaScript Expressions.

## Raw HTML

Until here we saw that whatever was inside our Mustache `{{ }}` was text, or interpreted as text, but what about if we want to bind some HTML? Imagine that we have a JSON where we have stored the content of the website, or we fetch it from the back-end. Most of the time, we will store the content as plain text, but sometimes we might get HTML instead.

For this, we will need to use the `v-html` **directive**. Don't worry, for now, we'll cover what directives are.

For the purpose of these tutorial let's put that HTML in our _title_ :

```javascript
new Vue({
	el: '#app',
	data: {
		title: "<h1 style='color: blue;'>I'm Interpolating!</h1>",
	},
})
```

In our HTML now we don't need to grab the `{{ title }}` inside the `h1` tag.

```html
<div id="app">{{ title }}</div>
```

As explained before, Vue will interpret this as text so the output will be 👇

<Image
	alt={`Interpolations`}
	src={`https://res.cloudinary.com/dccbkv4k0/image/upload/v1710323143/PxQfY7mA2_gfhj1n.jpg`}
	width={672}
	height={139}
	priority
/>

What we need to do in order to see our HTML as HTML is the following:

```html
<div id="app">
	<span v-html="title"></span>
</div>
```

We used an HTML tag, in this case, a `span`, inside its opening tag we added our directive `v-html`, and as a value, we passed our `title`. What Vue will do is to pass that value of `title` inside the span. Let's see if this time worked 👇

<Image
	alt={`Interpolations-2`}
	src={`https://res.cloudinary.com/dccbkv4k0/image/upload/v1710322916/GwUuAv-cQ_f4fl1e.jpg`}
	width={672}
	height={139}
	priority
/>

## Attributes

As we saw with the `v-html`, there are times when we need to pass certain values to our HTML, for that, we use directives. Imagine we have to put a dynamic `id`, inside of a `div` in our HTML. For this, we can use the `v-bind` directive. Again, don't worry, **directives will be cover in future episodes of this series**.

The syntax is quite similar as the previous example.

```html
<div id="app">
	<span v-bind:id="dynamicId"></span>
</div>
```

Look how we add `:id` after `v-bind` to tell Vue that what we want will be this `<span id="1"></span>`, well if dynamicId had the value of 1 😅

And we can do more with `v-bind`. Imagine we have a button that we want to show as disabled. All we have to do is to add `:disabled` at the end of `v-bind`. But for this, we won't give a value that Vue can interpret as a string. Vue needs to know if we want this button to be disabled, YES or NO, so will check if the value is true or false.

```html
<div id="app">
	<button v-bind:disabled="isButtonDisabled">Sign In</button>
</div>
```

In our case, `isButtonDisabled` is `undefined`, so Vue won't even render the attribute disabled, and this will happen if the value is also `null` or `false`.

## Conclusion

In this episode we covered the following:

1. We can do interpolations as plain **Text** with Mustache syntax `{{ }}`.
2. Inside the Mustache syntax we can have **JavaScript Expressions**.
3. To render **Raw HTML** we need the `v-html` directive.
4. We can dynamically change **Attributes** with the `v-bind` directive.
